## Agents Needed

1. **Data Collection Agent**: This agent autonomously gathers relevant data like tax codes, market trends, and data pertaining to the user's trading activities. It has reactivity to new data, a proactive drive to update information periodically, and it shares information with other agents in the system.

2. **Analysis Agent**: This agent is responsible for analyzing the data gathered. It has autonomy to make decisions in interpreting the data in the context of tax optimization strategies. Meanwhile, it proactively looks for patterns and potential optimization strategies and communicates these findings with other agents.

3. **Learning Agent**: This agent uses machine learning or similar methods to enhance the system's tax optimization strategies over time. As it processes data from historical outcomes of suggested strategies, it improves the quality of the strategies proffered to the users, aligning its goals to the larger system objective of maximizing tax efficiency for users.

4. **Decision-Making Agent**: After data has been analyzed the decision-making agent has the autonomy to decide which tax optimization strategies to suggest to the user. Its cognitive capabilities come into play here � it weighs up the pros and cons of each potential strategy based on present conditions and previous experiences.

5. **User Interface Agent**: This agent handles the social aspect of the system � it interacts with the user, providing them with the chosen tax optimization strategies, and collecting feedback. It also ensures alignment of the system's chosen strategies with the user's preferences. It has a specialized role and carefully shares its tasks with the other agents for optimal system functionality.

## Orchestration Operation

## Orchestration Process for handling user queries

### Task Decomposition and Assignment
**Task Analysis**: In our SaaS, when a user query is received, the orchestrator breaks it down into subtasks like identifying the type of tax, specific trading data extraction, applicable tax laws, etc.

**Agent Matching**: Then, it assigns these tasks to appropriate agents. For example, the trading data extraction task goes to a data extraction agent, the tax law determining task to tax law expert agent, etc.

### Communication and Coordination
**Standardized Protocols**: Agents are built using standardized communication protocols to understand and interact with each other's responses and create a cohesive answer.

**Feedback Mechanisms**: Agents provide feedback on their task completion to the orchestrator, helping adjust the workflow based on real-time experiences.

### Scalability and Flexibility
**Modular Design**: The system is built in a modular way, allowing the easy addition of new specialized tax agent or trading data extractor without disturbing the current process.

**Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Resources are efficiently managed allowing quick scale-up during high user query spikes.

### Context Management
**Global Context Awareness**: The orchestrator maintains a global context, enabling routing and assigning of tasks to agents while retaining the original query's context.

**Agent-Specific Context**: Each agent maintains its own task-specific conversation history for continuity in solving the assigned problem.

### Interoperability
**Platform Independence**: The system is designed to seamlessly integrate agents developed from different AI models and various platforms.

### Decision-Making and Conflict Resolution
**Intelligent Routing**: User queries, previous agent responses, and agent descriptions are analysed by the orchestrator to intelligently route tasks to the best-suited agent.

**Conflict Management**: The system can manage conflicts arising in cases of shared tax law access or data extraction queue by having a conflict resolution mechanism in place.

### Security and Data Management
**Secure Communication**: The system ensures secure communication between all agents, safeguarding user data and agent information.

**Efficient Data Handling**: Agents have quick access to user data and tax laws needed for the task.

### Performance Monitoring and Optimization
**Metrics Tracking**: The orchestrator monitors key metrics like task completion speed, agent resource usage, and query handling speed, etc.

**Continuous Improvement**: Using tracked data, the orchestrator refines task decomposition, agent assignment, and workflow.
